# Simple Container Block

The Simple Container Block is a container (i.e., wrapper) for other Gutenberg blocks. This block leverages the `InnerBlocks` component to render any number or type of blocks that you place within the container block. The plugin adds no styles or scripts to the front end, simply a wrapper `div` around the inner blocks along with any CSS classes or id that you specify.
